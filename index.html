            <h2>Contortionist Show in Grand Rapids</h2>

                <p>The Contortionist is a progressive metal band from Indianapolis, IN. In mid-2022, they set out on
                a tour on which they would be playing Exoplanet and Language, their first and third albums respectively, front-to-back. These albums feature many of their
                best songs including: Flourish, Advent, Vessel, Exoplanet I, II, and III, Language I and II, and Thrive. 
                This tour had two dates in Michigan, the first being Wednesday, September 28th in Detroit, MI at St. Andrew's Hall and the
                other being the following Monday, October 1st in Grand Rapids, MI at Elevation. However, on the 29th of September after having
                played the date in Detroit, they announced that they would be cancelling the Grand Rapids date. This led to the outrage of many (two, that we know of)
                of their Michigan local fans. The fans had planned to attend the Grand Rapids date to avoid the risk of injury at St. Andrew's Hall after the floor at said venue
                having <a href="https://www.fox2detroit.com/news/joint-became-loose-causing-floor-to-flex-at-saint-andrews-hall-during-concert-officials-say">nearly collapsed</a>
                during a show in March 2022. The band may have avoided some of the outrage had they announced the cancellation several days prior to at least inform their Michigan 
                fanbase that there would only be a single date in Michigan for the tour. The failure to do so has left several fans devestated, as the band is unlikely to ever
                perform most of the songs on the aforementioned albums live ever again, especially in the same manner. </p>

            <h2>Darkmoon Card Greatness</h2>
            <time datetime="2022-10-16" title="October 16, 2022">Oct 16, 2022</time>

            <p>
                Darkmoon Card: Greatness is a legendary piece of equipment in World of Warcraft: Wrath of The Lich King Classic. It is a crafted item that is BiS (Best-in-Slot)
                for any class that is able to take advantage of it throughout the first 2 raid tiers of the expansion, Naxxramas (Tier 7) and Ulduar (Tier 8). 
                Darkmoon Card: Greatness, much like all other Darkmoon Cards, is a trinket slot item. It provides +90 to a primary stat having four different versions, 
                one each for Strength, Agility, Intellect, and Spirit. It also has a proc which provides +300 to the same stat for 15 seconds with a 45 second internal
                cooldown, meaning that the proc cannot occur more than once every 45 seconds, so it can be active one third of the time. Though the item is very
                famous, it is also infamous. Its infamy derives from the expense to acquire it. There is a long process to crafting it and some lightly time-gated
                methods to acquiring it. The crafting is done by a scribe who mills herbs from Northrend to create Azure and Icy pigments, which are then converted to
                Ink of the Sea and Snowfall Ink, respectively. By combining 3 Ink of the Sea, 6 Snowfall Ink, and 3 Eternal Life (another item created by gathering herbs)
                on a piece of Resilient Parchment, the scribe can create a random Darkmoon Card of the North. There are 32 possible outcomes for this. The cards have a face
                value of Ace through 8 and there are four decks to which they belong: Undeath, Prisms, Chaos, and the deck which creates a Darkmoon Card: Greatness, Nobles. 
                By combining one of each face value of the same type of card, you create the corresponding deck which can then be handed in at the Darkmoon Faire. However,
                the Darkmoon Faire is only active one week out of the month, so naturally the price of the item goes up while it is not available, as no new DMCGs can be
                created. </p>
